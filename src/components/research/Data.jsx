  title: 'B-Dropshipper: Interoperable Federal Blockchain Approaches For Real Estate Dropshipping',
  description : 'Abstract — Real estate, a cornerstone of the global economy demands substantial investments with extended development cycles spanning years. While a few financially robust companies can withstand this, many lose their clientele due to a scarcity of available properties, while others grapple with unsold assets due to leaks of customers and exorbitant advertising costs. Collaborative efforts among real estate entities offer a remedy, mitigating unsold inventory risks and expediting returns on investments economically. Compounded by escalating property document discrepancies, litigation congestion has rendered property registration sluggish and costly. Consequently, fortifying property document security and transaction integrity is imperative. Existing solutions predominantly rely on Web2 technologies, which are susceptible to security breaches, jeopardizing property transaction data and trust among stakeholders, given the protracted payment structures spanning decades. This research advocates innovative solutions and proposes a Federal blockchain interoperable system for real estate property drop shipping. Where Property owners can create smart contracts specifying commissions, installment details, and more, offering properties to a common pool. Interested companies can subsequently acquire from the pool and sell these properties. Oversight of company registration, the pool, property sales, and installment management falls under the purview of a federal community regulatory committee. A reputation system fosters trust between property owners and sellers. In an experimental setup, Hyperledger Fabric serves as the foundation for the blockchain network, and Hyperledger Cactai facilitates interoperability between disparate blockchain networks, ensuring efficient communication between the pool, sellers, and property owners. This comprehensive approach addresses the multifaceted challenges facing the real estate industry, fostering transparency, security, and efficiency.',

  title: 'Farmbot: an IoT-Based Wireless Agricultural Robot for Smart Cultivation',
  description: 'Abstract — Smart technologies have significantly transformed various sectors, and agriculture is no exception. This paper aims to introduce a robot called "Farmbot" to revolutionize traditional farming techniques and enhance crop production. The construction of a radio frequency remote-controlled robot using Arduino microcontrollers and ultrasonic sensors is programmed to navigate by the farmer on the ground. The Farmbot aims to aid farmers by delivering valuable data through a smartphone app on moisture levels, soil\'s potential of hydrogen, temperature, humidity, and the presence of flammable gasses across distinct farm zones, all through a single set of sensors. It provides comprehensive insights into the overall land condition, enabling informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and the crucial steps required for optimal growth. To further enhance its utility and application, features such as fertilizer and insecticide dispersion and optional plowing functionality are incorporated into the robot to enhance agricultural efficiency, ensuring optimal crop health and pest control and saving labor. The experimental results will demonstrate the effectiveness of the Farmbot in assisting farmers with irrigation management, fertilization management, and automated farming tasks.',
